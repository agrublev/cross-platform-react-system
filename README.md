# Legendary

A react based system that can be run on virtual ALL platforms!

```bash
yarn
yarn start:web
yarn start:desktop
yarn start:mobile
```

## Because sharing is caring

All workspaces share the core resource located in ***./core*** meaning Web/Mobile/Desktop will all get the same value.

Shared node dependencies too! Meaning rather than 3 node_module folders that result in many megabytes of space, they all share react and other commonalities.



## The Perfect Boilerplates

After struggaling for too many hours to master the build process of iOS/Android/Electron/React/Babel/Webpack and god knows what else, I provide you with truly some of the very best possible solutions for each.



There simply has never been a better way to create a new application before!
